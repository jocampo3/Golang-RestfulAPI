# Golang RESTful API

Welcome to my **basic Golang RESTful API** repository! üöÄ

This project is a simple **microservice** that provides basic **CRUD operations** using the [Gin framework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin). It allows you to create, read, update, and delete album records.

## üìå Features
- ‚úÖ GET all albums
- ‚úÖ POST a new album
- ‚úÖ PUT (update) an existing album
- ‚úÖ DELETE an album
